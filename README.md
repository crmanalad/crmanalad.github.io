Greetings! This page is a work in progress and thanks for visiting.

### About Me

I am currently a student at University of California, San Diego majoring in Computer Engineering. My main programming language is C++ can also use C, Java, and ARM. I am currently looking forward to learning Python, C#, and more languages that I will come across with but these are my highest priority as they seem interesting to pick up. I also like to be a late night programmer as I am a bit nocturnal (which is why the page is on dark mode!). The comments I make in most of my programs tend to be horrid but I am currently working on fixing that so it is presentable so please let me know if there happens to be something confusing and I will take note of it.

P.S. I tend to be a bit private so I have not posted a self-photo for now. Thanks for understanding!
